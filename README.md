In case of you are unhappy with the z-axis-rotation of your joystick as a steering tiller, this might be interesting for you.

The little project was done on a sunday afternoon after some frustration with curvy steering on the taxiway.

I took into account the following Joystick-Library: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary.
This is a mandatory prerequisite. Thanks for that coding, Sir.

In addition there is another project which I was made aware of today, which is pretty cool as well: https://github.com/hotbso/tiller

# My Version
My version is relatively small next to the joystick and uses only quite short coding. Price of material is cheap. And with some soldering-affinity you should be able to make it.

I use a Thrustmater-joystick but no rudder pedals. I did never like the combination of steering and rudder on the same axis.

I felt the rotating z-axis as not precise enough for a proper feeling on ground.

Here is my little homemade solution.

I took an Arduino Leonardo (basically a pro micro derivat, IMPORTANT is the ATmega32u4-chipset for USB-joystick-protocol!!), a potentiometer and a button. Soldered everything together and adapted the example from the joystick-library. The little box is then connected as a joystick to the PC. You can calibrate and attach axis or functions to it within your simulator.

It feels way better to steer on the ground. Itâ€™s like driving your car. Super precise due to the wider usable angle.

If you wonder about the button and the LEDs:

The button is used as brake-control. You might use it as pedal disconnect instead of (or anything else).
The LEDs light up if turned to left (red) or right (green). Following the lights out philosophy they are dark if the steering tiller is in exact forward position. Out of the corners of my eye I can see red or green if not perfectly forward. This helps in aligning on the runway or at gate at low speed.

The schematic is easy, the code can be copied here and soldering is not a too big thing as well.

For me it made perfectly sense and the A320 feels even better now.

See attached circuit and code and off you go.
Have fun.

The potentiometer can have any value. it should be in the kOhm range to reduce current flow.
The resistors need to aligned with your LEDs. There are easy-to-use calculators in the net.

# Mini-Instructions

1. Solder as per schematic (circuit.png)
2. Plug-in your Leonardo or ProMicro to USB (ATmega32u4-chipset!!!)
3. Install Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
4. Install Joystick-Library from https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
5. Upload the code to the board (SteeringTiller.c copied into the IDE)
6. Use Game-Controller-settings in Windows to calibrate (search: 'USB-gamecontroller')
7. Start your simulator and attach functions to the new joystick (and delete some automatically linked functions)
8. Cruise the airport up and down
9. Smile (hopefully ;-))
