In case of you are unhappy with the z-axis-rotation of your joystick as a steering tiller, this might be interesting for you.
In adavance I'd like to highlight that this is not a copy of anyone else. The little project was done on a sunday afternoon after some frustration with curvy steering on the taxiway.
I took into account the following Joystick-Library: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
This is a mandatory prerequisite. Thanks for that coding, Sir.
In addition there is another project which I was made aware of today, which is pretty cool as well: https://github.com/hotbso/tiller

My version is a bit smaller and with a bit less coding. Price of material is cheap. Ans with some soldering-affinity you should be able to make it.
